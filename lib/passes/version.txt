The following improvements on the passes lib were made:

- standardized module processing
- better and complete context generation
  especially for the invariants:
    - defuse:    every use of a variable is now located in terms of linenr and
                   variable (def) name
                 unknowns are named "-" but have correct line numbering
    - loads:     name of the variable is now correct
    - function:  linenr at start of function
    - loopcount: location is at first line of loop
- comments added for clarity
